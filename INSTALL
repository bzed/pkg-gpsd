Run ./configure (or sh configure if the script does not have execute
permission).

Check the Makefile.

run make:  libgpsd.a, gpsd, gps, xgpsspeed, and gpsplay are built.

Copy the applications wherever you want them to live.

Copy the app-defaults file Gps to your home directory or to the
system-wide X app-defaults directory.

The "right" thing to do is, to start gpsd on a serial or USB port that has the GPS
connected to it.

Then start gps and have it connect to gpsd via a socket. Give it a device
name like "localhost:2947", which means: connect to the host localhost using
port 2947.

You can also telnet to this port for testing. When doing that, type an 'R'
followed by <cr>. This should display the RAW nmea sentences the deamon
receives from the gps.

You can (but please don't) connect gps (the program) directly to a serial
port and a GPS (the device).   This mode won't do DGPS nor handle timeouts.
