<h3><a name="_What_chip_set">Q: What chip set does this receiver use?</a></h3>

<p>A: This receiver contains a SiRF chip set. It is programmed to
operate in NMEA-0183 upon power up. It can be set to output data in SiRF
format. See the documentation on the CD-ROM that is shipped with the receiver.</p>

<h3><a name="_What_is_…?"></a>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3><a name="_Can_you_tell"></a>Q: Can you tell me if the GPS receiver will output
the 1 PPS without connection to RS-232?</h3>

<p>A: Yes, 1 PPS is available on Pin 19, Normally low with 100ms
TTL high pulse once every second.</p>

<h3><a name="_The_description_states">Q: The
description states that this unit has an RS-232 level shifter installed. Does
this mean that the unit can be connected directly to a PC without the need for
a level conversion and inversion circuit?</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A: Correct, please refer to the above table &quot;Minimum
connections to make receiver work:&quot;</p>

<h3><a name="_Is_there_a"></a>Q: Is there a way to disable or remove the RS232
driver?</h3>

<p>A: One buyer has reported that you can remove the RS-232 driver
chip and there are pads that can be shorted to bring out the TTL serial to
connector J1. I would suspect that this is true because these receivers could
be ordered with or with out the driver chip, however I have not verified this
information.</p>

the same 5V supply (assuming a 5v antenna is used)?</h3>
