<h1>Axiom Sandpiper II</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These pages describe the Axiom Sandpiper II GPS module.  The
manufacturer went out of business some time between 2000 and 2006, but
many of these are still available cheaply in 2006 via eBay and from
electronics surplus stores.  They seem to be popular with radio
hams.</p>

<p>This is a SiRF device.  However, it doesn't come up in SiRF binary,
nor have we ever seen it respond to the $PSRF we use as a SiRF probe.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The material in these pages (other than this one) was extracted
from descriptive materials supporting an eBay auction.  Material
specific to the auction has been removed, leaving the technical
content, vendor spec sheets, and manuals in place.  The very bulky
but largely content-free manual for the Windows exerciser software 
has been omitted.</p>

<h2>Interfacing to the bare module</h2>

<p>These materials describe the bare OEM module.  An anonymous note
referenced from the web page tells us the basics of interfacing to it.
It has two rows of pins, the pin with the square pad is pin 1. The
pins are numered as follows:</p>

<listing>
 1  2
 3  4
 5  6
 7  8
 9  10
11  12
13  14
15  16
17  18
19  20
</listing>

<p>The module is already RS-232 ready, no need for a level-converter chip
(MAX-232). For a serial connection to your PC all you need to do is apply
power(+5vdc) and wire TX,RX, and ground to your PC. Once powered up the
receiver will output NMEA at 4800,8,n,1. If you want to you can add a
battery backup (3.6vdc); there is a pin for this. This will allow the
receiver to lock onto a signal within 10 seconds. On first power up don't
expect a lock for about 90 to 120 seconds.</p>

<h2>If it has an enclosure...</h2>

<p>You may find your unit is enclosed in a black plastic case with a
DB9 on a connector coming out of it and two connectors on it.  If
so,</p>

<ul>

<li>The DB9 should be a regular serial port.  Here are the pin
assignments:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>1</td><td>PPS</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>RX</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>TX</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>open</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>ground</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>open</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>open</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>open</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>open</td></tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>

<li>The brass-colored screw connector sticking out one side is an AMPS-style
antenna connector.</li>

<li>The post-in-a-well connector on the bottom is the power
connector. It wants regulated 5VDC, positive center.</p>
</ul>

<p>The power connector is physically and electrically compatible with
the semi-standard 5-volt power supplies used on routers and USB hubs.  The
2.5A power supply from a dead Linksys router seems to do nicely.</p>
