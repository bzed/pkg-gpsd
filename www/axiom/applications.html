<h1>Applications buyers are using these receivers for:</h1>

<h2>Time synchronization of your home network.</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>There are free public domain applications
to grab the time from the GPS module and synchronize all of your PCs to this
NTP server. Search www.google.com for these applications.</p>

<h2>Wardriving with Netstumbler</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Users use this GPS to record
coordinates to a log file. Then you can use the exported logs to import the
data into a mapping program to locate WiFi access points.</p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Used with most any mapping software
that accepts generic NMEA serial data.</p>

<h2>APRS</h2>

<ul>
<li>Connect the RS-232 serial output directly to your computer or
Byonics TinyTrak3 without any need for a level converter.</li>

<li>Can be connected to the X2 serial interface on the OpenTracker
APRS tracker to send position reports</li>

<li>Used with the TNC-X and the X-Track board Daughter Board to create an APRS
Tracker to transmit MIC-E encoded packets containing your position and beacon
information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Microcontroller</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Interfaced to a microcontroller such as
the Parallax Basic Stamp series or Bascom-AVR with the Atmel AVR
chips, for various microcontroller &amp; AVL projects.</p>

<h2>Other</h2>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Used with home made avionics computers for
onboard flight recording and tracking systems for Model Rockets,
Airplanes, Balloons and outdoor robotic systems.</p>
