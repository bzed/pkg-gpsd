<h1 align='center'><code>gpsd</code> &mdash; a GPS service daemon</h1>

<p>This is the new home page of <code>gpsd</code>, moved from
www.pygps.org in August 2004.  <code>gpsd</code> has just undergone a
major rewrite; this fixed many bugs and added many new features,</p>

<p><code>gpsd</code> is a service daemon that monitors a GPS attached
to a host computer through a serial or USB port, making its data on
the location/course/velocity of the sensor available to be queried on
TCP port 2947 of the host computer.  With <code>gpsd</code>, multiple
GPS client applications (such as navigational and wardriving software)
can share access to a GPS without contention or loss of data. Also,
gpsd responds to queries with a format that is substantially easier to
parse than NMEA 0183.  The <code>gpsd</code> distribution includes a
linkable C service library and/or a Python module that developers of
<code>gpsd</code>-aware applications can use to encapsulate all
communication with <code>gpsd</code>.</para>

<p>The goal of the <code>gpsd</code> project is to create a solid layer of
open-source infrastructure for programs that want to be
location-sensitive. We aim for simple, robust interfaces, unfussy
operation, and an easy learning curve for application developers.</p>

<p>We have a <a href='hardware.html'>list of compatible GPSses</a>
with some technical information.  We also have <a href='NMEA.txt'>a
list of NMEA sentences</a>.</p>

<p>If you are new to GPS technology and don't quite understand what
<code>gpsd</code> is about, you might find <a
href="gps-hacking.html">ESR's Guide to Hacking With GPS</a>
interesting</p>

<p>There is at least one fork of <code>gpsd</code> in the wild, but
there are plans to unfork it soon.  You can read a brief <a
href="history.html">history</a> of the <code>gpsd</code> project if
you are curious.</p>

<h1>Code and community</h1>

<p>Look in the <a
href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2116">download</a>
directory for tarballs of all released versions. Access to the
bleeding-edge developer version is supported <a
href="http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=2116">via
Subversion</a>.  The main project page is <a
href='http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/'>here</a>.</p>

<p>There are three project mailing lists:</p>

<ul>
<li><a
href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-announce">gpsd-announce</a>
is for release announcements and project news.</p></li>
<li><a
href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">gpsd-users</a>
is for questions and technical support on <code>gpsd</code>, including support
for application builders using <code>gpsd</code> as a component.</p></li>

<li><a

<h1>Introduction to gpsd</h1>

<p><code>gpsd</code> takes input from a device capable of generating
positional data (like a GPS or a Loran receiver) and republishes it on
a well-known TCP/IP port in a simpler format.  Multiple clients can
connect to this port and get data from the GPS; the daemon multiplexes
all requests and prevents contention.  A client can also request raw
NMEA 0183 data from the originating GPS (this makes sense for debugging,
but probably not much else).</p>

<p><code>gpsd</code> was meant to make programs like <a
href="http://www.pygps.org">pyGPS</a> hardware independent. With
<code>gpsd</code>, pyGPS allows you to show the position of the GPS on
an electronic map. Since the computer running <code>gpsd</code> and
the one running pyGPS do not have to be the same machine, you can
remotely display the position of one computer on the other.  Other
applications that use <code>gpsd</code> include <a
href="http://www.kismetwireless.net/">Kismet</a> and <a
href="http://www.gpsdrive.cc/">GPSdrive</a>.</p>

<dt><a href="libgps.html">libgps.3</a></dt>
<dd>An interface library that manages communication with the daemon.</dt>

<dt><a href="gpsprobe.html">gpsprobe.1</a></dt>

<p>Note that these describe gpsd-2, not the 1.x versions you may have
seen before.</p>

<h1>The gps client</h1>

<p>Included in the package is a sample client called <code>gps</code>. It
connects to a <code>gpsd</code> at any host you tell it to, and
requests raw data, so that it can display the current location of all
visible GPS satellites your receiver 'sees'.</p>

<p><img SRC="gpsd1.gif" ALT="[image] The GPS receiver has no fix yet."/></p>

<p>The GPS receiver has not yet acquired a fix.  The receiver has not
tracked the grey satellites, but knows where they should be.</p>

<p>The next image shows a good fix. A 3d fix provides latitude, longitude
as well as altitude data, and requires at least four good satellites. A
2d fix does not give altitude, but only requires 3 satellites.</p>

<p><img SRC="gpsd2.gif" ALT="[image] The GPS receiver has a good 3d fix."/></p>

<p>Depending on your GPS receiver, the additional satellites may be used
to determine location with better accuracy.</p>

<h1>Recipes and related resources</h1>

<p><code>gpsd</code> also works with <a href="bt.html">bluetooth
GPS</a> receivers.</p>
