<h1 align='center'>GPSD &mdash; a GPS service daemon</h1>

<p>This is the new home page of gpsd, moved from www.pygps.org in
August 2004.  gpsd has just undergone a major rewrite at the hands of
Eric S. Raymond; the upcoming 2.0 version will add many new features,
including a linkable C service library that developers of gpsd-aware
applications can use to encapsulate all communication with gpsd.</p>

<p>The goal of the gpsd project is to create a solid layer of
infrastructure for open-source programs that want to be
location-sensitive. We aim for simple, robust interfaces, unfussy
operation, and an easy learning curve for application developers.</p>

<p>If you are new to GPS technology and don't quite understand what
gpsd is about, you might find <a href="gps-hacking.html">ESR's Guide
to Hacking With GPS</a> interesting</p>

<p>There is at least one fork of gpsd in the wild, but there are plans
to unfork it soon.  You can read a brief <a
href="history.html">history</a> of the gpsd project if you are
curious.</p>

<h1>Code and community</h1>

<p>Look in the <a href="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/gpsd/">download</a>
directory for tarballs of all released versions. We've now done our
first release through berlios (1.9.0), and access to the bleeding-edge
developer version is supported
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=2116">via Subversion</a>.</p>

<p>There are three project mailing lists:</p>

<ul>
<li><a
href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-announce">gpsd-announce</a>
is for release announcements and project news.</p></li>
<li><a
href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">gpsd-users</a>
is for questions and technical support on gpsd, including support
for application builders using gpsd as a component.</p></li>

<li><a
href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd-dev</a>
is for gpsd developers.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Introduction to gpsd</h1>

<p>gpsd is a translator. It takes input from a device capable of
generating positional data (like a GPS or a Loran receiver) and
translates it into another, very simple format.  A client that feels
lucky can also request raw NMEA data from the originating GPS.  This
makes sense for debugging, but probably not much else. Gpsd
re-publishes the data on a networking port via TCP/IP.  Multiple
clients can connect to this port and get data from the GPS; the
daemon will multiplex all requests from them and prevent contention.</p>

<p>gpsd was meant to make programs like <a
href="http://www.pygps.org">pyGPS</a> hardware independent. With gpsd,
pyGPS allows you to show the position of the GPS on an electronic
map. Since the computer running gpsd and the one running pyGPS do not
have to be the same machine, you can remotely display the position of
one computer on the other.  Other applications that use gpsd include
<a href="http://www.kismetwireless.net/">Kismet</a> and 
<a href="http://www.gpsdrive.cc/">GPSdrive</a>.</p>

<p>There are three manual pages describing the code:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="gpsd.html">gpsd.1</a></dt>
<dd>The gpsd daemon.</dd>

<dt><a href="libgpsd.html">libgpsd.3</a></dt>
<dd>An interface library that manages communication with the daemon.</dt>

<dt><a href="libgps.html">libgps.3</a></dt>
<dd>The low-level library used by gpsd to talk to a GPS.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that these describe gpsd-2, not the 1.x versions you may have
seen before.</p>

<h1>The gps client</h1>

<p>Included in the package is a sample/simple client called 'gps'. It connects
to a gpsd at any host you tell it to, and requests raw data, so that it can
display the current location of all visible GPS satellites your receiver
'sees'.</p>

<p><img SRC="gpsd1.gif" ALT="[image] The GPS receiver has no 'fix' yet." height=462 width=628></p>

<p>The GPS receiver has not yet acquired a fix. It only 'sees' satellites
06 and 17. The receiver has not received the grey satellites, but knows
where they 'should' be.</p>

<p>The next image shows a good 'fix'. A 3d fix provides latitude, longitude
as well as altitude data, and requires at least four good satellites. A
2d fix does not give altitude, but only requires 3 satellites.</p>

<p><img SRC="gpsd2.gif" ALT="[image] The GPS receiver has a good '3d' fix." height=462 width=628></p>

<p>Depending on your GPS receiver, the additional satellites may be used
to determine location with better accuracy.</p>

<h1>Recipes and related resources</h1>

<p>gpsd also works with <a href="bt.html">bluetooth GPS</a> receivers.</p>
