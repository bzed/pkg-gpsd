This document is mastered in asciidoc format.  If you are reading it in HTML,
you can find the original at http://gpsd.berlios.de/AIVDM.txt[]

== Introduction ==

This is a description of how to decode AIVDM/AIVDO sentences.  It
collects and integrates information from publicly available sources
amd is intended to assist developers of open-source software for
interpreting these messages.

AIVDM/AIVDO sentences are emitted by receivers for AIS, the marine
Automatic Identification System. All cargo vessels of more than 300
tons displacement and all passenger vessels are supposed to carry AIS
transmitters that periodically broadcast their position and course,
using TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) technology similar to the
way cellphones do to avoid mutual interference.

Technically, AIVDM packets are reports from other ships and AIVDO
packets are reports from your own ship. AIS receivers capture AIVDM
squawks and report them as ASCII data packets over serial lines, using
the NMEA 0183 data format and physical network standards.

A lengthy description of AIS, focusing on the goals and history of the
system, but not describing the data protocols in any detail, can be
found at <<AIS>>.

== Standards ==

ITU Recommendation M.1371, "Technical Characteristics for a Universal
Shipborne Automatic. Identification System Using Time Division
Multiple Access" <<ITU1371>>, issued in 2001, describes the format of
AIS binary messages. It is proprietary, expensive, and surrounded by
attack lawyers, which is why this document exists.  I have not looked
at it.

ITU-R M.1371 is expanded and clarified by "IALA Technical
Clarifications on Recommendation ITU-R M.1371-1" <<IALA>>, which
is freely available.

The ASCII format for AIS messages seems to have been set by IEC-PAS
61162-100, "Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and
systems" <<IEC-PAS>>. It is proprietary and I have not looked at it.
Various public sources indicate that it has been "harmonized" with some
version of NMEA 0183 <<NMEA>>, which I also have not looked at because
it too is proprietary and expensive, and surrounded by even more
rapacious attack lawyers.

== Information Sources ==

Together, the the IALA Technical Clarifications at <<IALA>> and the
Coast Guard's AIS pages at <<NAVCEN>> describe AIS message payloads
almost completely.  The detail information on payload formats in this
document is derived from these.

Kurt Schwehr is a research scientist at the Center for
Coastal and Ocean Mapping at the University of New Hamphire. Much of
his research involves AIS.  His work blog at <<Schwehr>> contains
sample messages and descriptions of AIS operation in the wild that
shed light on various obscure corners of the specification.  He has
explained the otherwise undocumented Repeat Indicator field and USCG
extended AIVDM to me by email. He also communicated some critical
information from <<IEC-PAS>>.

== Open-Source Implementations ==

The http://gpsd.berlios.de/[GPSD project] ships an AIVDM/AIVDO
sentence decoder. This document was developed to be the specification 
for it.

<<Schwehr>> includes links to a collection of Python scripts for
decoding and analyzing AIVDM sentences.  Kurt Schwehr warns that this
is research code rather than a production tool.

There is a http://gnuais.sourceforge.net/[GNU AIS] project at
SourceForge.  It seems intended primarily to work directly
with AIS radios.

There's a http://rl.se/aivdm[web form] that does sentence decoding.

== AIVDM/AIVDO Sentence Layer ==

AIVDM/AIVDO is a two-layer protocol.  The outer layer is a variant of
NMEA 0183, the ancient standard for data interchange in marine
navigation systems; NMEA 0183 is described at <<NMEA>>.

Here is a typical AIVDM data packet:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
!AIVDM,1,1,,B,177KQJ5000G?tO`K>RA1wUbN0TKH,0*5C
--------------------------------------------------------------------

And here is what the fields mean:

Field 1, !AIVDM, identifies this as an AIVDM packet.

Field 2 (1 in this example) is the count of fragments in the currently
accumulating message.  The payload size of each sentence is limited by
NMEA 0183's 82-character maximum, so it is possible to split a payload
over several fragment sentences.

Field 3 (1 in this example) is the fragment number of this
sentence. It will be one-based.  A sentence with a fragment count of
1 and a fragment number of 1 is complete in itself.

Field 4 (empty in this example) is a sequential message ID for
multi-sentence messages.

Field 5 (B in this example) is a radio channel code. AIS uses the high
side of the duplex from two VHF radio channels: AIS Channel A is
161.975Mhz (87B); AIS Channel B is 162.025Mhz (88B).

Field 6 (177KQJ5000G?tO`K>RA1wUbN0TKH in this example) is the data
payload. We'll describe how to decode this in later sections.

Field 7 (0*5C) is the NMEA 0183 data-integrity checksum for the sentence,
preceded by "0*" to aid simpleminded NMEA parsers.  It is computed
on the entire sentence including the AIVDM tag but excluding the
leading "!".

For comparison, here is an example of a multifragment sentence with a
nonempty message ID field:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
!AIVDM,2,1,3,B,55P5TL01VIaAL@7WKO@mBplU@<PDhh000000001S;AJ::4A80?4i@E53,0*3E
!AIVDM,2,2,3,B,1@0000000000000,2*55
--------------------------------------------------------------------

== AIVDM/AIVDO Payload Armoring ==

The data payload is an ASCII-encoded bit vector.  Each character
represents six bits of data.  To recover the six bits, subtract 40
from the ASCII character value; if the result is greater than 40
subtract 8. According to <<IEC-PAS>>, the valid ASCII characters for
this encoding begin with "@" (64) end with "W" (87).

Concatenate all six-bit quantities found in the payload, MSB first.
This is the binary payload of the sentence.  

== AIVDM/AIVDO Payload Interpretation ==

AIVDM data is encoded as bitfields in the sentence.  The bitfields are
generally interpreted as big-endian twos-complement integers; when
signed, the sign bit is the highest.  Many fields have an associated
divisor which should be applied to convert to the correct units.

Note that many sources use 1-origin numbering for the bits.  We'll
use 0-origin in this document.

The first 6 bits of the payload (0-5) are the message type.  Message
types are as follows:

.Message types
`--`-------------------------------------------------
01 Position Report Class A
02 Position Report Class A (Assigned schedule)
03 Position Report Class A (Response to interrogation)
04 Base Station Report
05 Ship and Voyage data
06 Addressed Binary Message
07 Binary Acknowledge
08 Binary Broadcast Message
09 Standard SAR Aircraft Position Report
10 UTC and Date Inquiry
11 UTC and Date Response
12 Addressed Safety Related Message

19 Extended Class B Equipment Position Report
20 Data Link Management
21 Aids-to-navigation Report
22 Channel Management
23 Group Assignment Command
24 Class B CS Static Data Report 
25 Binary Message, Single Slot
26 Binary Message, Multiple Slot
-----------------------------------------------------

In normal operation, an AIS transceiver will send a position report
(type 1, 2, or 3) every 2 to 10 seconds depending on the vessel's
speed while underway, and every 3 minutes while the vessel is at
anchor and stationary. It will send a type 5 identification every 6
minutes.   (More detail is at <<IALA>>, part 2.3)

Class 8 is in common use for private encrypted messages, such as
location transmission in military exercises.

Other message types are unusual or rare, and many AIS transponders
never emit them.

An MMSI is a Mobile Marine Service Identifier, a unique 9-digit ID 
for the ship's radio(s).  The first three digits convey information
about the country in which the ID was issued <<ITU-MID>>.

Detailed descriptions of message types 1-5, 9, and 18 follow.
Information sufficient to decode other message types in the range 6-22
can be found in <<IALA>>, but they are rare or not of general interest
so we will not duplicate the information here. Message types 23-24 are
listed at <<BOSUN>> with no further information; message types 25-26
come from <<Schwehr>>>, who reports they were added in Version 3 of
<<ITU1371>>.

=== Types 1, 2 and 3: Position Report Class A ===

Type 1, 2 and 3 messages share a common reporting structure for
navigational information; we'll call in the Common Navigation
Block. This is the information likely to be of interest for decoding
software.

The Repeat Indicator is a directive to an AIS transciever that this
message should be rebroadcast.  This was intended as a way of getting
AIS messages around hills and other obstructions in coastal waters,
but is little used as base station coverage is more effective.  It is
intended that the bit be incremented on each retransmission, to a
maximum of three hops.

Turn rate is encoded as follows:

* 0...126 = turning right at up to 708 degrees per minute or higher
* 0...-126 = turning left at up to 708 degrees per minute or higher
* 127 = turning right at more than 5deg/30s (No TI available)
* -127 = turning left at more than 5deg/30s (No TI available)
* –128 (80 hex) indicates no turn information available (default)

Values between 0 and 708 degrees/min coded by ROTAIS=4.733 *
SQRT(ROTsensor) degrees/min where ROTsensor is the Rate of Turn as
input by an external Rate of Turn Indicator. ROTAIS is rounded to the
nearest integer value.  Sign of the field should be preserved when
squaring it, otherwise the left/right indication will be lost.

Speed over ground is in 0.1-knot resolution from 0 to 102 knots.
value 1023 indicates speed is not available, value 1022 indicates
102.2 knots or higher.

Position accuracy flag indicates the accuracy of the fix.  A value of
1 indicates a DGPS-quality fix with an accuracy of < 10ms.  0, the
default, indicates an unaugmented GNSS fix with accuracy > 10m.

Longitude is given in in 1/10000 min. Values up to plus or minus 180
degrees, East = positive, West = negative.  A value of 181 degrees
(0x6791AC0 hex) indicates that longitude is not available and is the
default.

Latitude is given in in 1/10000 min. Values up to plus or minus 90
degrees, North = positive, South = negative. A value of 91 degrees (0x3412140
hex) indicates latitude is not available and is the default.

Seconds in UTC timestamp should be 0-59, except for these special values:

* 60 if time stamp is not available (default)
* 61 if positioning system is in manual input mode
* 62 if Electronic Position Fixing System operates in estimated (dead
     reckoning) mode,
* 63 if the positioning system is inoperative.

The Regional Reserved field is intended for use by local maaritime
authorities.  It is not known to be in any actual use up to 2009.

The Maneuver Indicator (143-144) may have these values:

* 0 = Not available (default)
* 1 = No special maneuver
* 2 = Special maneuver (such as regional passing arrangement)

The interpretation of bits 143-147 has been a bit unstable. In
<<IALA>>. and therefore in the original <<[ITU1371>>, they were 
described like this:

`-------`---`------------------------`-----------------------------------------
Field   Len Description                       Units
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
143-145  3  Regional Reserved
146-147  2  Spare
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The interpretation of 143-144 as a special maneuver field is new in
revision 3 of <<[ITU1371>>.

The RAIM flag indicates whether Receiver Autonomous Integrity
Monitoring is being used to check the performance of the EPFD.
0 = RAIM not in use(default), 1 = RAIM in use.  See <<RAIM>> for
a detailed description of this flag.

Bits 149-167 are diagnostic information for the radio system.  Consult
<<IALA>> for detailed description of the latter.  Total of 168 bits,
occupying one AIVDM sentence.

=== Type 4: Base Station Report ===

Total of 168 bits, occupying one AIVDM sentence.

The standard uses "EPFD" to designate any Electronic Position Fixing Device.

=== Type 5: Ship static and voyage related data ===

Message has a total of 424 bits, occupying two AIVDM sentences.

Character-string fields are encoded in a special way. Each six-bit
segment maps to an ASCII character.  Segments 0-31 map to the
characters @ through "\_" respectively; segments 32-63 map to ASCII
characters " " (space) though "?". Lowercase ASCII letters, the
backtick, right and left curly brackets, pipe bar, tilde and DEL
cannot be encoded.
 
According to the standard, trailing unused characters will be
represented by "@" (six-bit zero). It is common to space-fill the 
fields instead, so a decoder should strip trailing spaces well as
at-signs.

In practice, the information in these fields (especially ETA and
destination) is not reliable, as it has to be hand-updated by
humans rather than gathered automatically from sensors.

Altitude is in meters.  The special value 4095 indicates altitude is
not available; 4094 indicates 4904 meters or higher.

Speed over ground is in knots, not deciknots as in the common
navigation block; planes go faster. The special value 1023 indicates
speed not available, 1022 indicates 1022 knots or higher.

Position Accuracy, Longitude, Latitude, and Course over Ground
are encoded identically as uin the common navigation block and
are even at the same bit offsets.  Time stamp has the same special
values as in the common navigation block, but is at a different offset.

=== Type 18: Standard Class B CS Position Report ===

A less detailed report for vessels using Class B transponders.  Omits
navigational status and rate of turn.  Fields are encoded as in the
common navigation block.

== Local extensions ==

Some regional authorities extend the AIS message set.

The St. Lawrence Seaway broadcasts hydrological and lock-scheduling
messages using special encodings of the binary data of message types 6
and 8 (described in <<SEAWAY>>, freely available), and safety
information using types 12 and 14.

The U.S. Coast Guard has a system called PAWSS (Port and Water Safety
System) which uses extended AIS binary formats. <<SEAWAY>> says it's
intercompatible with the St. Lawrence Seaway system; I have not been
able to find any message documentation, however.

=== U.S. Coast Guard Extended AIVDM ===

You may occasionally see AIVDM packets with additional comma-separated
fields following the CRC-32 checksum.  This is a semi-obsolescent
logging format used by the USCG, which has never documented it well
and plans to replace it with a new one based on NMEA 4.0.

Here's a sample sentence and field breakdown:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!AIVDM,1,1,,B,15Cjtd0Oj;Jp7ilG7=UkKBoB0<06,0*63,s1234,d-119,T12.34567123,r003669958,1085889680
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following the "*63" checksum are additional fields delimited by commas.  
These fields provide additional metadata about the reception of each AIS  
broadcast.

The field beginning with the lower case "s" is a Relative Signal  
Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurement from the receiver. This  
measurement has a range of 0-65535. This is one of the parameters used  
internally by the AIS receiver to determine the signal strength value as  
reported in the field beginning with the lower case "d". This field only  
exists when the AIS receiver provides this data.

The field beginning with a lower case "d" is the signal strength  
measurement for this broadcast in dBm. This field only exists when the  
AIS receiver provides this data.

The field beginning with the upper case "T" is the Time of Arrival  
of the received broadcast in seconds from UTC 0. This field only exists  
when the AIS receiver provides this data.

Another optional field not shown is one that begins with an upper  
case "S" and represents the slot number in which the reception occurred.  
The field would appear after the checksum and before the station  
identifier field. This field only exists when the AIS receiver provides  
this data. Example: S0042

The field beginning with the lower case "r" is a station identifier  
field. This field is always provided, regardless of the type of AIS  
equipment.  (Occasionally a base station identifier will be prefixed with
"b" instead.)

The last field is a time tag based on the standard C programming  
language time function. Both date and time to the nearest second can be  
derived from this field. This field is always provided, regardless of  
the type of AIS equipment.

== Change history ==

Version 1.0 was the initial release covering messages 1-3, 4, and 5.

Version 1.1 adds message breakdowns for 9 and 18, explanation of the
Repeat Indicator feld, and the explanation of USCG extended AIVDM.

Version 1.2 adds information on the the ITU1371 edition 3 maneuver field,
and the RAIM flag. It also adds an important clarification about
six-bit decoding.
