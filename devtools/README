This is a list of developer tools included in the SVN source tarball
but not necessarily shipped in the tarball or binary distributions If you're
viewing it with Emacs, you can try doing Ctl-C Ctl-t browse through
the outline headers.  Ctl-C Ctl-a will unfold them again.

** ais.py

AIS packet decoder in Python.  Useful as a check on the C code.

** fakecompare

Compare the results from running gpsfake on a logfile between this
machine and a remote one.  Especially useful when remote and local
have different word lengths.

** findbreakage

Starting from a specified SVN revision number, this Python program runs 
regression tests forward until something fails.  It uses a binary search, so
convergence should be very rapid.

** leapsecond.py

Gets the current leap-second correction forom IERS and/or the USNO.

** logextract

Extract pure NMEA from an emailed gpsd error log. The output can be fed 
to gpsfake. (This one goes in the tarball.)

** regress-builder

This script runs an exhaustive test on combinations of compilation options, 
looking for ones that break the build.

** striplog

Strip leading comment lines from NMEA sentence logs.  gpsfake can do
this itself now, so this script has a lot of dust on it.
