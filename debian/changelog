  * Removing Tachometer.c due to an unclear licensing, this introduces
    .dfsg to the version number and results in not being able to build
    xgpsspeed.
  * Building new packages:
    - python-gps containing the python modules, this also fixes a bug
      complaining about missing python-support (Closes: #413925)

  * Auto discovery of USB GPS devices is disabled by default now, as the USB
    devices use nothing but a standard usb to serial converter. This resulted
    in trouble if you wanted to use a normal serial converter without attached
    GPS device. A rules file is provided as example now.

      packaging (debian/{gpsd,gpsd-clients}.install, debian/gpsd.examples)
      and removes several unused/obsolete files:
      (debian/{remove_rpath.sh,gpsd-clients.docs}, debian/*.dirs,
       debian/gpsd.lintian-overrides).
  * debian/watch, debian/dfsg-clean.sh:

      non-free material automatically.
