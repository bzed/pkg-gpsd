Description: GPS (Global Positioning System) daemon
 gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes attached to a host
 computer through serial or USB ports, making all data on the location/course/
 velocity of the sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947 of the host
 computer.
 .
 With gpsd, multiple GPS client applications can share access to GPSes without
 contention or loss of data. Also, gpsd responds to queries with a format that
 is substantially easier to parse than the NMEA 0183 emitted by most GPSes.

Suggests: python-gps, gpsd
Description: Clients for the GPS daemon
 gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes attached to a host
 computer through serial or USB ports, making all data on the location/course/
 velocity of the sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947 of the host
 computer.
 .
 This package contains auxiliary tools and example clients for monitoring and
 testing gpsd.

Description: Python interface to gpsd and testing environment
 gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes attached to a host
 computer through serial or USB ports, making all data on the location/course/
 velocity of the sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947 of the host
 computer.
 .
 This package contains a Python interface to conntect to gpsd, together with
 a module providing a controlled testing environment. It also ships two tools
 which utilize the interface: gpsprof for latency-profiling and gpsfake to
 simulate a GPS by playing back a logfile.

Package: libgps17
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: C library for communicating with GPS devices
 libgps is a service library for querying GPS devices. There are two
 interfaces supported by it:
   * A high-level interface that goes through gpsd, a service daemon that
     monitors one or more GPS devices. It is intended for concurrent use by
     several applications.
   * A low-level interface that speaks directly with the serial or USB
     device to which the GPS is attached.

 This package contains the header and development files needed to build
 programs and packages using libgps.
