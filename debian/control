Description: GPS (Global Positioning System) daemon
 gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes attached to a host
 computer through serial or USB ports, making all data on the location/course/
 velocity of the sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947 of the host
 computer.
 .
 With gpsd, multiple GPS client applications (such as navigational and war-
 driving software) can share access to GPSes without contention or loss of
 data. Also, gpsd responds to queries with a format that is substantially
 easier to parse than the NMEA 0183 emitted by most GPSes.
 .
 The gpsd distribution includes a linkable C service library and a Python
 module that developers of gpsd-aware applications can use to encapsulate
 all communication with gpsd.
 .
 For a couple of clients, install the gpsd-clients package.

 This package contains auxiliary tools for diagnostic monitoring and profiling
 of GPSes and feeding GPS-aware applications specified track data for
 diagnostic purposes.

Description: Python interface to gpsd and testing environment
 gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes attached to a host

 velocity of the sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947 of the host

 .
 This package contains a pure Python interface to gpsd, together with a
 module providing a controlled testing environment.
