.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
gpscat
is a simple program for logging and packetizing GPS data streams\&. It takes input from a specified file or serial device (presumed to have a GPS attached) and reports to standard output\&. The program runs until end of input or ot is interrupted by ^C or other means\&.
.PP
In raw mode (the default)
gpscat
simply dumps its input to standard output\&. Nonprintable characters are rendered as hexadecimal string escapes, except for CR followed by LF or LF preceded by CR\&.
.PP
In packetizing mode,
gpscat
uses the same code as
\fBgpsd\fR(8)\'s packet sniffer to break the input into packets\&. Packets are reported one per line; line breaks in the packets themselves are escaped\&.
.PP
This program is useful as a sanity checker when examining a new device\&. It can be used as a primitive NMEA logger, but beware that (a) interrupting it likely to cut off output in mid\-sentence, and (b) to avoid displaying incomplete NMEA sentences right up next to shell prompts that often contain a $, raw mode always emits an extra final linefeed\&.
.PP
Also, be aware that packetizing mode will produce useless results \(em probably consuming the entirety of input and appearing to hang \(em if it is fed data that is not a sequence of packets of one of the known types\&.
.PP
The program accepts the following options:
.PP
\-p
.RS 4
Invoke packetizer mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s
.RS 4
Set the port\'s baud rate (and optionally its parity and stop bits) before reading\&. Argument should begin with one of the normal integer baud rates (300, 1200, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, etc\&.)\&. It may be followed by an optional suffix [NOE][12] to set parity (None, Even, Odd) and stop bits (1 or 2)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t
.RS 4
Invoke packetizer mode, with the packet type and length (in parentheses) reported before a colon and space on each line\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
In packetizer mode, enable progress messages from the packet getter\&. Probably only of interest to developers testing packet getter changes\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Display program usage and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 4
Display program version and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
Specifying \-s 4800N1 is frequently helpful with unknown devices\&.
