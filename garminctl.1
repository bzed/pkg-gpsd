.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
garminctl switch a serial Garmin GPS to NMEA or Garmin Binary mode\&. On exit it leaves the serial port set to the proper baud rate\&.

.PP
This program is not for use with Garmin USB devices\&. Those are permanently set to Garmin Binary mode\&.

.PP
You will probably need to be root to run this program, as the serial device it uses is normally privileged\&.

.PP
The program accepts the following options:

.TP
\-?
Display program usage and exit\&.

.TP
\-b
Force GPS into binary mode\&. After the GPS resets itself autobaud to the new speed\&. Binary mode is always 9600 8N1\&.

.TP
\-n
Force GPS into NMEA mode\&. After the GPS resets itself autobaud to the new speed\&.

.TP
\-h
Display program usage and exit\&.

.TP
\-D
Set debug level\&.

.TP
\-V
Display program version and exit\&.

.SH "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"

.PP
The logic for hunting the GPS's baud rate is vulnerable to various sorts of RS232 flakiness\&. If it hangs for longer than a few seconds, kill the program and restart\&.
