.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
These are the demonstration clients shipped with
gpsd\&. They have some common options:
.PP
The
\fB\-h\fR
option causes each client to emit a summary of its options and then exit\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-V\fR
option causes each client to dump the package version and exit\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-j\fR
option, where present, tells the daemon to hold fix data across cycles, eliminating jitter from NMEA devices that emit several partial reports\&. The downside is that with this switch on the client will occasionally report stale or invalid data held over from a previous cycle\&. This option is ineffective, and not needed, on SiRFs and most other non\-NMEA GPSes\&. See also the discussion of the J command in
\fBgpsd\fR(8)\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-l\fR
option, when present, sets the format of latitude and longitude reports\&. The value \'d\' produces decimal degrees and is the default\&. The value \'m\' produces degrees and decimal minutes\&. The value \'s\' produces degrees, minutes, and decimal seconds\&.
.PP
An optional argument to any client may specify a server to get data from; a colon\-separated suffix is taken as a port number\&. If there is a second colon\-separated suffix, that is taken as a device name to be handed to the daemon in an F= command (or equivalent)\&.
.PP
Not all clients shipped with GPSD are documented here\&. See also the separate manual pages for
\fBgpspipe\fR(1)
and
\fBgpsmon\fR(1)\&.
.SS "xgps"
.PP
xgps
is a simple test client for
gpsd
with an X interface\&. It displays current GPS position/time/velocity information and (for GPSes that support the feature) the locations of accessible satellites\&.
.PP
In the sky view, satellites are color\-coded to indicate quality of signal; consult the data display to the left for exact figures in dB\&. Diamond icons indicate WAAS/EGNOS satellites, circles indicate ordinary GPS satellites\&. Filled icons were used in the last fix, outline icons were not\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-speedunits\fR
option can be used to set the speed units for display; follow the keyword with knots for nautical miles per hour, kph for kilometres per hour, or mph for miles per hour\&. The default is miles per hour\&. This option can also be set as the X resource \'speedunits\'\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-altunits\fR
option can be used to set the altitude units for display; follow the keyword with \'meters\' or \'feet\'\&. The default is feet\&. This option can also be set as the X resource \'altunits\'\&.
.PP
There is a known bug in
xgps; it assumes the default font size is no more than 18 pixels\&. If this is not the case, the satellite data display will show fewer than 12 satellites\&.
.SS "xgpsspeed"
.PP
xgpsspeed
is a speedometer that uses position information from the GPS\&. It accepts an \-h option and optional argument as for
gps, or a \-V option to dump the package version and exit\&. Additionally, it accepts \-rv (reverse video) and \-nc (needle color) options\&.
.PP
The \-speedunits option can be used to set the speed units for display; follow the keyword with knots for nautical miles per hour, kph for kilometres per hour, or mph for miles per hour\&. The default is miles per hour\&. This option can also be set as the X resource \'speedunits\'\&.
.SS "cgps"
.PP
cgps
is a client resembling
xgps, but without the pictorial satellite display and able to run on a serial terminal or terminal emulator\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-s\fR
option prevents
cgps
from displaying the raw data\&. This display can also be toggled with the s command\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-m\fR
option will display your magnetic heading (as opposed to your true heading)\&. This is a calculated value, not a measured value, and is subject to a potential error of up to two degrees in the areas for which the calculation is valid (currently Western Europe, Alaska, and Lower 48 in the USA)\&. The formulas used are those found in the Aviation Formulary v1\&.43\&.
.PP
Rather than use X resources to determine which units to use,
cgps
looks at variables in its environment\&. Here are the variables and values it checks:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
    GPSD_UNITS one of: 
              imperial   = miles/feet
              nautical   = knots/feet
              metric     = km/meters
    LC_MEASUREMENT
	      en_US      = miles/feet
              C          = miles/feet
              POSIX      = miles/feet
              [other]    = km/meters
    LANG
	      en_US      = miles/feet
              C          = miles/feet
              POSIX      = miles/feet
              [other]    = km/meters

cgps
terminates when you send it a SIGHUP or SIGINT; given default terminal settings this will happen when you type Ctl\-C at it\&. It will also terminate on \'q\'
.SS "lcdgps"
.PP
A client that passes
gpsd
data to
lcdproc, turning your car computer into a very expensive and nearly feature\-free GPS receiver\&. Currently assumes a 4x40 LCD and writes data formatted to fit that size screen\&. Also displays 4\- or 6\-character Maidenhead grid square output\&.
.PP
Options are as for
cgps, except: The
\fB\-u\fR
sets the display format the units used for altitude and speed\&. The options are:
\(lqi\(rq
for Imperial units (feet/miles\-per\-hour);
\(lqn\(rq
for nautical (feet/knots); \'m\' for metric (meters/kilometers\-per\-hour)\&.
.SS "gpxlogger"
.PP
This program collects fixes from
gpsd
and logs them to standard output in GPX, an XML profile for track logging\&.
.PP
The output may be composed of multiple tracks\&. A new track is created if there\'s no fix for an interval specified by the
\fB\-i\fR
and defaulting to 5 seconds\&.
.PP
If D\-Bus support is available on the host and GPSD is configured to use it, this program listens to DBUS broadcasts from
gpsd\&. (org\&.gpsd\&.fix)\&. Otherwise, it uses a conventional socket connection\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-j\fR
option is only meaningful in socket mode and when collecting fixes from an NMEA device\&. Presence of a server\-port\-device specification forces use of sockets even on a D\-Bus capable system, though this is unlikely to be of interest to anyone except GPSD developers\&.
