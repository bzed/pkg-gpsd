GENERAL
=======

gpsd is a user land daemon acting as a liason between a gps or
Loran-C receiver and clients. The receiver is expected to generate
position information as NMEA-0183 sentences, or Rockwell binary format,
although that can be changed.

gpsd listens on port 2947 for clients requesting position, time,
velocity or altitude information.

gpsd can take information from the gps and translate it into
something easier to understand for clients.

The client does not have to run on the same computer ;-)
I have a boat connected to the internet (Ricochet modem) running
gpsd, the maping program runs here at home (no, I will not give
you the boats IP address :-)

There is a GPS tester included. It is called "gps". It simply connects
to a GPS and displays your latitude, longitude, altitude, and the signal
quality from visible satellites.  When querying NMEA-compliant GPSes, it
will show a diagram of satellites in their current position in the sky.
It uses the same library code as gpsd.

gpsd is tested with DeLorme's TripMate, EarthMate and Garmin units.
Also with the BU-303 USB GPS sold as the NaviLock, Deluo, and Hyperdata.



CREDITS
=======

nmea_parse.c is modeled after code seen in gpstrans-0.31b by
Carsten Tschach.

Thanks to Bob Lorenzini <hwm@netcom.com> for his testing and feedback.

Thanks goes to Brook Milligan <brook@trillium.NMSU.Edu> for his
efforts to combine gpsd and gpsclient into one package.
He also changed the configuration method from Imake to GNU
autoconf. This made it easy to port the code to YOUR particular
platform.

Derrick J Brashear <shadow@dementia.org> (KB3EGH) added code for the
EarthMate DeLame. He also added "incredibly gross code to output
NMEA sentences" (his own words :-) He also did the first cut at
DGPS support (see http://www.wsrcc.com/wolfgang/gps/dgps-ip.html), 
for the Earthmate.

Curt Mills <BowHunter@mail.com> (WE7U) furthered the dgps support,
writing the portion for other GPS receivers.

Tom Mayo <tmayo1@rochester.rr.com> N1MU contributed the G/g command,
which returns a 6 digit Maidenhead grid square.

Be advised: any bugs in this code are mine, and mine only ;-)

Thanks for Russ Nelson for providing a home for gpsd!

This is as it stands today, Feburary 05 2002.

Actually, some bugs may be mine too now. Sorry.

Or mine.  I drastically rewrote this code to clean it up and extend it
New features include:
   * Documentation (what a concept!)
   * Cleaned up, simplified command-line options.
   * It understands the GLL (Geographic position - Latitude, Longitude)
     sentence from NMEA 3.0. 
   * It now parses both variants of the VTG sentence correctly.
   * New y and z commands support signal-status reporting and satellite
     location -- it should no longer ever be necessary for clients to go to
     raw mode.
   * Massive refactoring -- one main loop now calls a self-contained
     driver object for each type.
   * Cleaned-up error reporting, we don't use syslog when running in foreground
     but send all error and status messages to the tty instead.
