fix formatting in (gpsd.c)handle_request(). the sprintfs...

Bug complaints from the Kismet author:
 * No error output to the user if /dev/gps doesn't exist or if theres an
   IO error
 * Corruption - I haven't seen this too often, but it has a tendency to
   blat out illegal coordinates when it gets confused

Autodetect USB GPS by scanning the USB bus, if no device is specified.
