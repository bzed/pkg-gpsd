1. Make a tarball of CVS HEAD available for testing.

2. Update <http://www.pygps.org/gpsd/gpsd.html> and 
   <http://www.pygps.org/gpsd/protocol.html>, which are now
   seriously out of date.

3. Create a new libgpsd.a that is a linkable interface
   to the daemon.  The idea is for applications like gpsdrive
   to be able to link this and get GPS service.

4. Split the gpsd interface code out of pygps into a Python 
   module that can be shipped with gpsd.

5. File renames: 

     send_nmea.c -> libgps_core.c
     tm.c        -> nmea_drivers.c
     em.c        -> earthmate.c

   Yes, I could do these destructively, but I'd prefer to to lose the
   project history.  Unfortunately, CVS being what it is, I can't do
   this without write access to the project repository.

6. Make RPMs available.  I've built a working specfile.

Someday: 
Autodetect USB GPS by scanning the USB bus, if no device is specified.
