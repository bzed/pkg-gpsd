1. The shared-library mess

Ugh.  libtool makes me want to puke, but I am being forced to the conclusion 
that we may have to use it.  Can I get a patch from somebody that understands
this crap that will 

(a) Arrange for both libgps.a and libgpsd.a to be installed as shared libraries

(b) Do the right things to gpsd.spec.in so RPM will know about them.

(c) And, ideally, beat libtool senseless until it puts the libraries in
the *current* directory, where they're visible, instead of hiding them 
in that evil .libs thing...

2. Testing on EarthMate and TripMate

Would somebody please test the device types that aren't straight NMEA?
(This translates as: Hey, you, Russ!  Get off your tuchis! :-))

3. The strange math problem in gpsprobe 

I have a Python script I'd like to ship with 2.0, called gsprobe.  It
watches the NMEA from a GPS and tries to deduce things about the GPS.
It generates a gnuplot scattergram of fixes you can use to empirically
check accuracy against the reported HDOP.

However, something is awry in my calculation of the actual uncertainty 
of position, going from degrees of uncertainty to meters.  I posted about 
this earlier today.  Help!

4. Should PRWIZCH support drop out entirely?

I asked this question before and nobody answered.  At the moment I have the
PRWIZCH handling conditioned out.  I'd like to drop it entirely -- the 
information it gives is redundant with the SNRs in GPGSV, and the Zodiac
chipset reported GSVs.  

Does anyone know any good reason not to just drop this code?

6. Autodetect USB GPS by scanning the USB bus, if no device is specified.

This is a long-term wishlist item.  It's going to be difficult, since there
is no GPS device class yet.
