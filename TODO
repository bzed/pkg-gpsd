1. Make a tarball of CVS HEAD available for testing.

2. Update <http://www.pygps.org/gpsd/gpsd.html> and 
   <http://www.pygps.org/gpsd/protocol.html>, which are now
   seriously out of date.

3. Split the gpsd interface code out of pygps into a Python 
   module that can be shipped with gpsd.

4. File renames: 

     send_nmea.c -> libgps_core.c
     tm.c        -> nmea_drivers.c
     em.c        -> earthmate.c

   Yes, I could do these destructively, but I'd prefer not to lose the
   project history.  Unfortunately, CVS being what it is, I can't do
   this without write access to the project repository.

5. Make RPMs available.  I've built a working specfile.

Someday: 
Autodetect USB GPS by scanning the USB bus, if no device is specified.
