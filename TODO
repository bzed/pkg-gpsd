fix formatting in (gpsd.c)handle_request(). the sprintfs...

Bug complaints from the Kismet author:
 * No error output to the user if /dev/gps doesn't exist or if theres an
   IO error
 * No satellite positional info.  Everything that needs to know
   individual sat map stuff uses debug mode and parses NMEA itself, this
   is redundant
 * Corruption - I haven't seen this too often, but it has a tendency to
   blat out illegal coordinates when it gets confused
