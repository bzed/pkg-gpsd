* Testing on EarthMate and TripMate

Would somebody please test the device types that aren't straight NMEA?
(This translates as: Hey, you, Russ!  Get off your tuchis! :-))

* The strange math problem in gpsprobe 

I have a Python script I'd like to ship with 2.0, called gsprobe.  It
watches the NMEA from a GPS and tries to deduce things about the GPS.
It generates a gnuplot scattergram of fixes you can use to empirically
check accuracy against the reported HDOP.

However, something is awry in my calculation of the actual uncertainty 
of position, going from degrees of uncertainty to meters.  I posted about 
this earlier today.  Help!

* Should PRWIZCH support drop out entirely?

I asked this question before and nobody answered.  At the moment I have the
PRWIZCH handling conditioned out.  I'd like to drop it entirely -- the 
information it gives is redundant with the SNRs in GPGSV, and the Zodiac
chipset reported GSVs.  Does anyone know any good reason not to just 
drop this code?

* Autodetect USB GPS by scanning the USB bus, if no device is specified.

This is a long-term wishlist item.  It's going to be difficult, since there
is no GPS device class yet.
