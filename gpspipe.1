.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 8
\fBgpspipe\fR [\-h] [\-n\ \fIcount\fR] [\-r] [\-R] [\-s\ \fIserial\-device\fR] [\-t] [\-w] [\fIserver\fR [\fI:port\fR]]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
gpspipe
is a tool to connect to
gpsd
and output the received sentences to stdout. This makes the program useful as a pipe from
gpsd
to another program or file. Presently it only connect to
gpsd
on the localhost on the default port (2947).
.PP
gpspipe
does not require root privileges, and can be run concurrently with other tools connecting to the local
gpsd
without causing problems.
.PP
The output will consist of one or both of the raw NMEA or native
gpsd
sentences. Each line can be optionally time stamped. There is also an option to exit gracefully after a given count of packets.
.PP
An optional argument may specify a server to get data from; a colon\-separated suffix is taken as a port number.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-h makes
gpspipe
print a usage message and exit.
.PP
\-r causes raw NMEA sentences to be output.
.PP
\-R causes super\-raw (gps binary) data to be output. This overrides NMEA and gpsd output modes.
.PP
\-s option causes the collected data to be written to the specified serial device.
.PP
\-w causes native
gpsdsentences to be output.
.PP
\-t adds a timestamp to each sentence output.
.PP
\-n [count] causes [count] sentences to be output.
gpspipe
will then exit gracefully.
.PP
\-V prints the version, then exits.
.PP
One or both or \-r and \-w must be specified.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
When
gpsd is running\fBgpspipe \-r \-n 100\fR
will send one hundred raw NMEA sentences to standard output, then exit.
