.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
gpspipe is a tool to connect to gpsd and output the received sentences to stdout\&. This makes the program useful as a pipe from gpsd to another program or file\&. Presently it only connect to gpsd on the localhost on the default port (2947)\&.

.PP
gpspipe does not require root privileges, and can be run concurrently with other tools connecting to the local gpsd without causing problems\&.

.PP
The output will consist of one or both of the raw NMEA or native gpsd sentences\&. Each line can be optionally time stamped\&. There is also an option to exit gracefully after a given count of packets\&.

.PP
An optional argument may specify a server to get data from; a colon\-separated suffix is taken as a port number\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
\-h makes gpspipe print a usage message and exit\&.

.PP
\-r causes raw NMEA sentences to be output\&.

.PP
\-s option causes the collected data to be written to the specified serial device\&.

.PP
\-w causes native gpsdsentences to be output\&.

.PP
\-t adds a timestamp to each sentence output\&.

.PP
\-n [count] causes [count] sentences to be output\&. gpspipe will then exit gracefully\&.

.PP
\-V prints the version, then exits\&.

.PP
One or both or \-r and \-w must be specified\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

.PP
When gpsd is running  \fBgpspipe \-r \-n 100\fR will send one hundred raw NMEA sentences to standard output, then exit\&.
