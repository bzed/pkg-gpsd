 * The current (fixed) leap-second correction, and the future Unix
 * time after which to start hunting leap-second corrections from GPS
 * subframe data if the GPS doesn't supply them any more readily.
 *
 * Deferring the check is a hack to speed up fix acquisition --
 * subframe data is bulky enough to substantially increase latency.
 * To update LEAP_SECONDS and START_SUBFRAME, see the IERS leap-second
 * bulletin page at:
 * <http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/products/bulletins/bulletins.html>
 *
 * You can use the Python expression
 *	time.mktime(time.strptime(... , "%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S"))
 * to generate an integer value for START_SUBFRAME.
