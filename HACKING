			Hacker's Guide to gpsd

This is not a complicated piece of code.  Essentially, it spins in a loop 
polling for input from one of three sources:

1) The GPS, connected via serial or USB device.

2) A client making requests over a TCP/IP port.

4) A DGPS server issuing periodic differential-GPS updates.

GPS input updates an internal data structure called gNMEAdata, which has
slots in it for all the data you can get from a GPS.  Client commands mine
that structure and ship reports up the socket to the client.  DGPS data is
passed through, raw, to the GPS 

The program supports multiple GPS types.  All are represented by
driver method tables; the main loop knows nothing about the driver
methods except when to call them.  At any given time one driver is
active; by default it's the NMEA one.  A driver may change the active
type, in which case the new driver's initializer method should be
called before processing goes any forther.

That's about all there is to it.
