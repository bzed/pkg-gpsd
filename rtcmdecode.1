.SH "NAME"
rtcmdecode \- decode RTCM104 streams into a readable format
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 11
\fBrtcmdecode\fR [\-d] [\-e] [\-v\ \fIdebuglevel\fR] [\-V]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is a decoder for RTCM\-104, an obscure and complicated serial protocol used for broadcasting pseudorange corrections from differential\-GPS reference stations\&. RTCM\-104 is expected on standard input; an equivalent, 100%\-information\-preserving text format is written to standard output\&.
.PP
You can use this tool with
\fBnc\fR(1)
to examine RTCM feeds from DGPSIP servers or Ntrip broadcasters\&.
.PP
The decoder dump format is described in
\fBrtcm\fR(5); these lines go to standard output\&. As well as data the decoder also prints decoder status messages to standard error, as necessary\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The \-d option tells the program to decode RTCM\-104 presented on standard input to a text dump in the format of
\fBrtcm-104\fR(5)
on standard output\&. This is the default behavior\&.
.PP
The \-e option option tells the program to encode a text dump in the format of
\fBrtcm-104\fR(5)
to standard output\&. Encoding is supported only RTCM104v2, not for RTCM104v3\&.
.PP
The \-V option directs the program to emit its version number, then exit\&.
.PP
The \-v option sets a verbosity level\&. It is mainly of interest to developers\&.
.SH "APPLICABLE STANDARDS"
.PP
The applicable standard for V2 is
RTCM Recommended Standards for Differential NAVSTAR GPS Service
RTCM Paper 194\-93/SC 104\-STD\&.
.PP
Note that
rtcmdecode
presently recognizes only the 2\&.1 level of RTCM; the protocol was revised up to a version 2\&.3 including additional messages relating to GLONASS and real\-time kinematics before being deprecated in favor of V3\&. It is now obsolete\&.
.PP
The applicable standard for V3 is
RTCM Standard 10403\&.1 for Differential GNSS Services \- Version 3
RTCM Paper 177\-2006\-SC104\-STD\&.
.PP
Ordering instructions are accessible from the website of the
\fIRadio Technical Commission for Maritime Services\fR\&[1]
under "Publications"\&.
.SH "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"
.PP
RTCM3 decoding is buggy and incomplete\&.
.PP
RTCM\-104 represents floating\-point quantities as an integer multiple of a fixed scale factor\&. Editing an RTCM\-104 dump can produce numbers that are not an integer multiple of the scale factor for their field\&. If you do this, the value actually packed into binary RTCM\-104 will be rounded down to the nearest scale unit, and dumping will show slightly different numbers than those you entered\&.
.PP
The decoder logic is sufficiently convoluted to confuse some compiler optimizers, notably in GCC 3\&.x at \-O2, into generating bad code\&.
